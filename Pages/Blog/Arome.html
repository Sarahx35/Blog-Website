            <h4><em>Arôme’s Famous Honey Butter Toast</em></h4>
            <p>As if I’m the lead in Mamma Mia, I hum the sweet symphony whilst tucking into the Honey Butter Toast from Arôme bakery.</p>
            <p>Hidden in the back streets of Covent Garden, the surrounding restaurants silently preparing for the busy day ahead, Arôme bakery is already heaving with people.</p>
            <p>In my British nature, I immediately joined the slow moving line that had descended out of the shop door; that was when I realised I found a pot of gold.</p>
            <p>Coming across this particularly decadent cake online, it was my first trip of the day in London, hoping to beat the crowds that I knew would suffocate London’s tourist hub later on.</p>
            <p>Thus, I was slightly miffed to join the back of a queue that stared into a brimming cafe that held not a single seat.</p>
            <p>Step by step, I grew closer to the door, and my boyfriend became increasingly more agitated. This was due to my constant fretting that the one cake that had brought me to the city may well not be there as I continued to crane my neck to gain a better view of the well conceleaded cakes counter.</p>
            <p>Five minutes later, I was in the door and my heated stance was tranquillised by the delightful aroma that scented the bakery.</p>
            <p>The next few minutes were a blur of awkwardly shouting over the resounding chatter that echoed off the hard furnishings and escaping the crowds swarming through the door like Bees in the Queen’s hive.</p>
            <p>There in my hands was the famous Honey Butter Toast, still warm from the oven – a pleasant surprise on a winter’s day.</p>

            <p>In the shape of a bar of soap the size of my hand, the doughnut type bread was cut into a rectangular shape. Sticky but not unbearably so, the outer shell (much like French toast) was crispy and coated in Honey.</p>
            <p>I was unable to resist taking a bite before finding somewhere to sit. (This is an impossible task near the bakery – I recommend heading to the embankment where you gain a good view whilst your senses devour the glorious sugar high.)</p>
            <p>Coating my tongue was a buttery flavour that was instantly replaced with pure Honey – a significant sweetness that will satisfy your sugar craving for at least an hour or so.</p>
            <p>It was like biting into toast, except in the middle the bread texture is more like a doughnut. Soft yet chewy.</p>
            <p>I have never been lucky enough to try something so unique as this until now. Sitting under the winter sun with a view out towards the London Eye with my mouth full of nectar flavoured bread, my seven o’ clock start to London was given a nod of approval.</p>
            <p>Based on Mercer Street, if you dare to forfeit your health for the calorific yet delicious delicacy, I guarantee that you will be humming the Abba song as the blissful sugar rush buzzes through your veins.</p>
            <p>Eat at your own risk though, as the honey blues can sting!</p>
