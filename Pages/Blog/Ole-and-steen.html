            <h4>Ole & Steen – worth a visit?</h4>
            <p>Most come to London with a specific aim for the trip. Visiting a museum, a famous landmark or maybe even seeing that pop star who is perhaps a little too big to perform elsewhere in the South.</p>
            <p>My reason: food.</p>
            <p>This is partially an exaggeration. My boyfriend, who I was visiting, will perhaps be offended by the above, but it is evidently clear that my stomach is the taskmaster of my weekends.</p>
            <p>I first came across Ole & Steen on my way back from Arôme Bakery. With my stomach already content and a warning groan from my partner, I filed away the name of the bakery and continued onwards through the heaving streets of Central London.</p>
            <p>Therefore, upon my return to the city, I found myself internally drooling at the window of the Ole & Steen bakery, that only sat a few shops down from a Lamborghini dealer.</p>
            <p>Well renowned for being inexplicably shy, I waited until another walked into the bakery before I entered. This didn’t take long with the sunshine pouring onto the streets of London’s well renowned museum hub.</p>
            <p>Home to the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museum, the list is endless of what one can do in South Kensington.</p>
            <p>The roaring engine of a Ferrari 488 rolling up to the lights opposite the bakery, broke me from my trance and I stepped through the threshold of the shop and was instantly greeted with a wide smile.</p>
            <p>I preferred to prepare my order before standing at the counter, but the glass window did not contain any labels or descriptions as to what each cake was. Thus, pushing me further out of my comfort zone, I simply took a guess.</p>
            <p>The labels were awkwardly placed behind the counter and with precariously bad eyesight, that I pretended was not quite bad enough to conform to wearing glasses every day, I took a chance.</p>
            <p>My research on their social media led me to believe their “Social” cakes were their speciality. So, the words “Cinnamon social” fell from my lips and I found myself sitting on a high stool that looked out of a window facing a Maserati dealership.</p>

            <p>The experience felt ostentatious to say the least. I felt almost ashamed scoffing a sticky delicacy when a man in a tailored navy suit was showing people, dressed head to toe in labels, around cars that cost more than everything I owned.</p>
            <p>This awkwardness quickly dissipated when my mouth was coated with a tsunami of flavours and textures.</p>
