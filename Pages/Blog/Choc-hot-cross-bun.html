            <h4><em>The controversial ingredient that justified the ‘cross’ part of Easter Buns</em></h4>
            <p>In British society there are a multitude of topics like, Politics and Sports, that we simply avoid like the plague or accept that there will be a ferocious battle of words with a foe or even a friend.</p>
            <p>What one does not expect to get hot under the collar about, is whether chocolate should be in a Hot Cross Bun.</p>
            <p>A traditional fruit filled bun that provides sanctuary for the quivering stomachs that cannot bear any more chocolate over Easter. It has always been a firm favourite in the UK and has sat comfortably on the shelves being retrieved by passers by in the supermarkets without a whisper of judgement or horror.</p>
            <p>Not shy of being splashed across the front pages of the newspaper, Marks and Spencers decided to take the one remaining British tradition, that didn’t divide an uncle from his nephew, and added the one ingredient Easter time is not short of: chocolate.</p>
            <p>When showing the news article of this contentious product to my parents, one had narrowed their eyes, primarily to see the screen of my phone, whilst the other gawked in horror. When the words eventually unblurred for the squinting parent, they too verbally conveyed their discontent with a gasp and then a murmur under their breath at such a fallacious concept.</p>
            <p>At first, I was in complete agreement. Confounded by how chocolate bread could be considered a Hot Cross Bun, it almost felt like sacrilege.</p>
            <p>That was until I stood in M&S, with the plastic wrapping resting in my hands as I studied the ingredients. I almost found myself checking my surroundings, wondering what others must think of me as I contemplated buying and supporting such a controversial item.</p>
            <p>Did I need more chocolate added to my diet? I asked myself. Afterall, the classic fruit buns were delicious, why did it need to be ruined by chocolate? This was the question not only myself but the endless tabloids, who continued their vendetta alongside Aldi of the cloned caterpillar, asked.</p>
            <p>Gripped by such an interesting twist, and discovering that it was in fact chocolate chips rather than currents in the chocolate bread, I put my legs into motion and my hand was swiping the card machine before I could say Chocolate Hot Cross Bun (quite a mouthful I must say.)</p>
            <p>Eager to settle the swinging of the seesaw inside my mind and find which side I sat on, I cut my shopping trip short. Racing back I was to discover whether I would be in agreement with the traditionalists or now an outcast of society who prays on wickedly delightful delicacies.</p>
            <p>Filled with a creamy yet bitter tang of chocolatey bread texture, the wideness of my eyes and the obnoxiously loud moan of approval summed up where I was now placed in this world.</p>
            <p>Granted, I most likely won’t be reaching for one of these when my belly is full of easter eggs on Easter Sunday. However, once I have risen from my cocoa coma, this will be next on my list, followed by an application to work at M&S’s factories and join this controversial cult that binds tradition with the unexpected.</p>
