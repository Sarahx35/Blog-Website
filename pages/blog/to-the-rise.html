            <h4><em>To The Rise’s Famous Cinnamon Bun</em></h4>
            <p>Located on the sunny coastline of Eastbourne, I found myself baking under the heat of the glorious April sun as I queued for the newly opened bakery in town.</p>
            <p>A pesto coloured green licked the outside walls, distancing itself from the more conservative shops that lined that side of the street.</p>
            <p>To The Rise had every right to be bold. Stepping into the small but cosy bakery, my eyes rolled across the endless rows of cakes. Varying in colour, gloss and consistency, it was almost daunting trying to decide as I inched closer and closer to the till.</p>
            <p>That was until my eyes landed on the star that had made To The Rise’s name rather apt: the Cinnamon Bun.</p>
            <p>I had only come across this bakery in the past month, but it was not unknown that this bun is one of their specialties.</p>
            <p>Finding myself at the counter, I declared my order, chomping at the bit to try it. Only to be thrown a challenging look. “Which one?”</p>
            <p>Steadying my racing heart, I realised in the midst of my preparation to not waste a single second at the till, I had missed the other sign…</p>
            <p>Clearly not the first to make this mistake, I was educated on the differences between the two; there was a Morning Bun and a Naked Bun.</p>
            <p>It was refreshing to discuss the options without a bored, glazed stare in return. The enthusiasm of their bakes on Instagram had amazingly been channelled into their customer service.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, before I could satisfy my ravenous disposition, I was given the ultimate task: paying.</p>
            <p>Laid out before me was a tablet shaped machine, that appeared relatively simple if your contactless card worked.</p>
            <p>Dolorously, I was met with the dreaded beep. “Insert your card.” It read. Signalling to the girl behind the counter as if I was drowning, I was guided to an oddly shaped slot.</p>
            <p>There was a fifty-fifty chance of getting it right. Unfortunately, I chose the wrong fifty and my card became lodged in the machine.</p>
            <p>Realistically, the fiasco probably only lasted a minute or so, but I certainly felt like I had earned my bun.</p>
            <p>With a naked Cinnamon Bun in hand, I placed myself on a bench admiring, not the glistening sea before me, but the swirl of a sugary ammonite.</p>

            <p>Melt in the mouth texture, I wondered why I had never tried such a delicacy before.</p>
            <p>Encased within the thick swirl, was a soft, yet moist dough teeming with flavoursome spices, whilst the crystallised sugar danced on my tongue.</p>
            <p>Enraptured by this Cinnamon heaven that clouded my senses, it was only on my last bite did I remember I was supposed to save half for later. The sensible part of my brain once again caved to my sweet claw that tore the bun to shreds without a second thought.</p>
            <p>Smacking my lips together, I slipped the folded brown paper bag into my coat pocket and swung my leg over my bike.</p>
            <p>Pedalling off towards the sea, I knew this bakery’s success was most certainly on the rise and their marvellous array of bakes were going nowhere.</p>
