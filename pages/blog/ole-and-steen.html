            <h4>Ole & Steen – worth a visit?</h4>
            <p>Most come to London with a specific aim for the trip. Visiting a museum, a famous landmark or maybe even seeing that pop star who is perhaps a little too big to perform elsewhere in the South.</p>
            <p>My reason: food.</p>
            <p>This is partially an exaggeration. My boyfriend, who I was visiting, will perhaps be offended by the above, but it is evidently clear that my stomach is the taskmaster of my weekends.</p>
            <p>I first came across Ole & Steen on my way back from Arôme Bakery. With my stomach already content and a warning groan from my partner, I filed away the name of the bakery and continued onwards through the heaving streets of Central London.</p>
            <p>Therefore, upon my return to the city, I found myself internally drooling at the window of the Ole & Steen bakery, that only sat a few shops down from a Lamborghini dealer.</p>
            <p>Well renowned for being inexplicably shy, I waited until another walked into the bakery before I entered. This didn’t take long with the sunshine pouring onto the streets of London’s well renowned museum hub.</p>
            <p>Home to the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museum, the list is endless of what one can do in South Kensington.</p>
            <p>The roaring engine of a Ferrari 488 rolling up to the lights opposite the bakery, broke me from my trance and I stepped through the threshold of the shop and was instantly greeted with a wide smile.</p>
            <p>I preferred to prepare my order before standing at the counter, but the glass window did not contain any labels or descriptions as to what each cake was. Thus, pushing me further out of my comfort zone, I simply took a guess.</p>
            <p>The labels were awkwardly placed behind the counter and with precariously bad eyesight, that I pretended was not quite bad enough to conform to wearing glasses every day, I took a chance.</p>
            <p>My research on their social media led me to believe their “Social” cakes were their speciality. So, the words “Cinnamon social” fell from my lips and I found myself sitting on a high stool that looked out of a window facing a Maserati dealership.</p>

            <p>The experience felt ostentatious to say the least. I felt almost ashamed scoffing a sticky delicacy when a man in a tailored navy suit was showing people, dressed head to toe in labels, around cars that cost more than everything I owned.</p>
            <p>This awkwardness quickly dissipated when my mouth was coated with a tsunami of flavours and textures.</p>
            <p>What appeared as almost a Danish pastry, I was fascinated by the texture. The layers were a happy medium between flaky pastry and a soft brioche type dough.</p>
            <p>The golden pastry was plaited and sliced to allow dips between the pastry where you could get a glimpse of the fillings within its grasp.</p>
            <p>I had expected a Cinnamon flavoured pastry, but rather the cold, gel-like texture told me it was more of a Cinnamon butter that had been spread on the pastry.</p>
            <p>Draped along the top like a sweet flavoured scarf was white icing that complimented the intense spice of Cinnamon and buttery pastry, providing a saccharine finale to each mouthful.</p>
            <p>The slice was enormous and felt particularly like good value for money, when surrounded by sports cars and hideously overpriced restaurants where chips were an optional extra.</p>
            <p>The Cinnamon pastry left my appetite temporarily fulfilled. But the question as to what the taste of the remaining vast quantity of cakes at the bakery entailed, provoked a second visit preemptively on my departure home.</p>
            <p>Returning to the same branch near South Kensington Tube station, I opted for a takeaway chocolate Muffin that was gifted in a slightly bigger box than I was expecting for my miniature rucksack.</p>
            <p>Despite this minor setback, I realised that I had become increasingly caught up on the more daring and unique delicacies to point where I had disregarded the more classical cakes.</p>
            <p>Finding a chocolate Muffin that tasted of cocoa, rather than an overly sugary sponge that only held a hint of chocolate, was a rarity.</p>
            <p>Thus, over the years, I had wiped my hands clean of Muffins, branding them as all the same and not worth the calories.</p>
            <p>It was Ole & Steen that rekindled my love for the chocolate Muffin.</p>
            <p>Once I had reached my destination of London Bridge, thanks to Southern Railways continuing poor service to London, I eventually opened the white cardboard box stamped with the royal seal of Ole & Steen.</p>

            <p>With a view out towards Tower Bridge, and a cold wall to perch on in the sweltering summer’s day, I decided to wet my mouth with a softly moist sponge that erupted a squeal of surprise and delight.</p>
            <p>“It actually tastes nice!” I exclaimed to my deeply uninterested partner. Arms folded, he responded with the typical response of “great” before turning his attention back to more important matters, like Tower Bridge splitting into two.</p>
            <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find I was not greeted with a sugary sponge that tasted of a cheap type of chocolate, that even a supermarket wouldn’t sell, but instead I was transported into a cocoa dream.</p>
            <p>The airy sponge that breathed out on every bite, was filled with spattering of dark chocolate chips, only adding to the sensational chocolate experience; it was almost as if I was back at Cadbury’s World.</p>
            <p>Swallowing the last bite of my Muffin, I realised that I had missed the bridge’s grand display.</p>
            <p>Surrounded by joyful tourists, ecstatic by their luck of being in the right place at the right time, I joined in with their beaming smiles for another reason.</p>
            <p>My faith in the chocolate Muffin had been restored.</p>
