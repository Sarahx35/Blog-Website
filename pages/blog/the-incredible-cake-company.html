            <p>The Diamond Jubilee – a day of celebrating the Queen and Chocolate Cupcakes.</p>
            <p>Wandering down a street rammed with red, white and blue clothed tables, cheers and excitable conversations echoed off the shops lining the street.</p>
            <p>In the distance held the musical concoction of the Jubilee celebrations and the frustration of everyday life being cut off from their usual routes.</p>
            <p>I carefully tucked the end of my dress behind me as I passed the sticky hands of a toddler engulfing an unidentifiable sweet treat.</p>
            <p>Finding my way through the crowds, I had no desire to join an awkwardly long table and socialise with the locals.</p>
            <p>I already had my eye on the prize.</p>
            <p>One of my favourite cafes in town – The Incredible Cake Company – I knew on this rather excitable day they would have something to fulfil my celebratory cravings.</p>
            <p>Squeezing my way through the crowds, with my feet tapping to the rhythm of the town hall’s bells, I found myself standing outside the sweet tooth of the road.</p>
            <p>On the left of the window displayed an eight tier cake the size of a child, that captivated me by the intricacies of the icing. Each layer telling a part of a fairytale story. While on the right was a more simplistic three tiered square cake. However, the design was not as conservative as the shape. Coated in black and grey marbled icing, sat on the top of this striking design was a fondant shaped skull. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the pronounced detail and shading that had been put into making such a creepy skull look even more realistic.</p>
            <p>I was so enchanted by their creativity, I almost lost the last seat in the bustling cafe.</p>
            <p>With a pat on the shoulder and pleasant greeting from my parents, we bundled into the cafe, eyeing up the remaining cramped table for three on the left.</p>
            <p>It may not have been a window seat, but nestled next to the array of fresh cakes that were all at my disposal, I did not mind.</p>
            <p>Heading to the counter, holding in my breath as I squeezed through a gap between two chairs the size of a cupcake, I breathed a sigh of relief when I was greeted by one of the staff at the till.</p>
            <p>My parents called over to me their routine order of a pot of tea for two, while my eyes wandered over the row of cakes. I had a habit of mentally tasting each one and weighing up which one I fancied the most.</p>
            <p>Nothing particularly struck my attention at that moment, so as the staff member served up the hot drinks, I was ready to declare my order of the red velvet cupcake that sat glowing in the corner.</p>
            <p>Yet just as the woman returned to the till, complimenting me on treating my parents to their drinks, reminiscing over the days of when her children were just as generous, (I remained silent on the oddly depressing comment), something caught my eye.</p>
            <p>One of the most charming aspects of this cafe is that even when the counter is full of cakes, the staff never stop baking. You will hear the sound of bowls clanging against the surface and the scrape of metal spoons guiding the mixture out into the baking tins, while your mouth is met with the warmth of a freshly baked sponge.</p>
            <p>Caught in a moment of asphyxiation, I was too shocked to breathe.</p>
            <p>It was a rarity to see a classic chocolate cupcake in a cafe, without a fruity or toothpaste twist added.</p>
            <p>Double checking with the jolly lady, it was confirmed that this freshly baked cupcake was in fact purely chocolate.</p>
            <p>Mirroring the woman’s grin, I finally began to share the excitement of the rest of the town.</p>
            <p>Hot footing it back to the table, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of my order.</p>
            <p>A few minutes later, the diamond of the jubilee sat in front of me, and with a couple of envious mumbles from my parents, I wasted no time in deconstructing the cake and beginning my ascent into heaven.</p>

            <p>Only studying the presentation for a mere second, I commented on the additional shavings of white chocolate and a singular milk button decorating the cake, before surrendering to the impatient growl of my stomach.</p>
            <p>Carefully unwrapping the patriotic cupcake case, I made sure to not knock over the slightly unbalanced cake, with the buttercream like the bearskin hat of a chocolate cupcake guard.</p>
            <p>I had low expectations on the flavour of the topping, most seeming to taste the same – sweetly coated butter.</p>
            <p>Ignoring my dad’s suggestions of slicing the hat off the cake, I decided to return to my childhood and awkwardly attempt to bite into both the sponge and the buttercream without my nose firing the buttercream off the cliff.</p>
            <p>I was successful, much to the disgruntled huff of my dad.</p>
            <p>I almost choked on the delight that filled my body at the cocoa jubilee party that descended on my tongue.</p>
            <p>The moist sponge was rich with a dark chocolate flavour, that carried a slight bitterness that eradicated any fears I had of reliving past saccharine experiences. The bitterness was complemented by the buttercream that only teased my tongue with sweetness. Rather it was like the butter and icing sugar had been fused with melted dark chocolate that had my eyes lifting to the heavens in bliss.</p>
            <p>Before I knew it, one bite had turned into a number I had lost count of, and all that was left to tell me my experience had not been a dream, were the runaway crumbs that scattered the black serviet covering the plate.</p>
            <p>For a moment I felt depleted that perhaps I would never taste a cupcake that glorious again. But with a multitude of whistles from the tipsy crowds staggering past the shop window, I knew that the jubilations had only just begun and I was now fully energised to face the rest of the celebrations.</p>
            <p>It may have been a day to celebrate the Diamond jubilee, but the crown jewel for me that weekend was the illustrious chocolate cupcake that I will think of in my dreams.</p>
